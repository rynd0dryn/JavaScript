    <strong>HTML</strong> is a language made of tags that help us
    tried <em>head, title, H(heading),</em>
    and paragraph tags so far.<br>
    Very few people know all the tags in HTML, but that is okay 
    because we can do a lot with just some basic tags. We can learn
    about new tags when we need them.</p>
